 This is the set up script for TDE SlackBuilds on Slackware 14.2/current for setting user preferences and options.

 Source archives must be placed in the 'src' directory or will be downloaded during the build from a geoIP located mirror site.

 A package build list is created, and successfully built and installed packages are removed from that list as the build progresses.

 US English is the default language and support for additional languages can be added.

 There is an option to abort the build on the final setup screen - so just run through the options and familiarize yourself with them before an actual build. " \

 This is the complete list of additional languages supported by TDE.

 Other package sources may not have support for all these additional languages, but they will be included in the build for that package when the translations are included in its source.
 If any other translation is included in the package source, it can be added here but won't be supported by TDE.

 Multiple selections may be made - space separated.

Do you want the build to \Zr\Z4\ZbStop\Zn at a failure or <\Z1C\Zb\Z0ontinue\Zn> to the next SlackBuild?

Build logs are $TMP/'program'-build-log, and configure/cmake error logs will be in $TMP/build/tmp-'program'.

A practical build method could be:

 1] build the \Zb\Zr\Z4R\Znequired packages with the \Zr\Z4\ZbStop\Zn option - if any SlackBuild fails, the temporary files for that build will be kept and the problem can be identified and the build restarted.
Any problems with the build environment will also become apparent here.

 2] then build other packages with the <\Z1C\Zb\Z0ontinue\Zn> option which deletes the temporary build files while the successful package builds are completing.
Any failures here are likely to be related to dependencies not found.

 3] re-run the build for the failed programs from [2] by re-using the build list and with the \Zr\Z4\ZbStop\Zn option ...

The default with the tqt3 build is to append the TDE lib paths to /etc/ld.so.conf.

This means that TDE libs will be at the end of the search path. If the package configuration sets up the search path without using the shell variables set up in this script, those TDE libs will not be used if a library of the same name exists - a conflict which could arise if another DE is installed.

If you experience any problems of this nature, then try the \Z1P\Zb\Z0repend\Zn option, which will set up doinst.sh for tqt3 to add the TDE libs paths to the beginning of the search path.

 Then \Zb\Z2rebuild tqt3\Zn. This build option only applies to that package.

There are three options that can be set up for building the imaging app in koffice.

[1] It is called \Zb\Z3chalk\Zn in TDE but is known as \Zb\Z3krita\Zn most other places.

[2] .pngs loaded into chalk/krita will crash if it is built with libpng-1.6, but will load if libpng-1.4 is used for the build.
  If libpng is chosen here, it will be added to the build list and the package placed in $TMP - not installed. It will then be installed by koffice.SB if the libpng unversioned headers and libs are not linked to libpng14.
  The koffice.SB will restore those links to libpng16 when the build has finished or failed.

[3] GraphicsMagick will enable an extended range of image formats to be loaded and saved. ImageMagick should be an alternative, but building fails with that, so without GM, the range of supported image formats will be limited.
  If GM is chosen here, it will be added to the build list if not already selected or installed." \

This routine creates and updates the git repositories local copies.

If this is a first run, answer 'yes' - be patient, downloads from git are slowwww...

For subsequent runs, 'yes' will update only.

Local repositories are created/updated as for the single downloads for R14.0.4 builds.
If the current build list includes new apps, and you don't want the existing repos updated, the new apps should be run as a new group initially as selective updating is not supported.

Do you want to create or update the git repositories?

You have chosen to re-use the TDE build list, which now contains only those programs that failed to build.

But this script is set to Continue in the event of a failure, which will delete all but the last build record. It will be easier to investigate each failure if the build is stopped when it fails.

Do you still want the build to \Zr\Z4\ZbContinue\Zn at a failure
 or change to \Z1S\Zb\Z0top\Zn ?
