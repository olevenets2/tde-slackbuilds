# By default, GraphicsMagick is compiled with support for OpenMP (http://www.openmp.org/) if the compilation 
# environment supports it. OpenMP automatically parallizes loops across concurrent threads based on instructions 
# in pragmas. OpenMP was introduced in GCC 4.2. OpenMP is a well-established standard and was implemented in
# some other compilers in the late '90s, long before its appearance in GCC. OpenMP adds additional build and linkage 
# requirements.
# By default, GraphicsMagick enables as many threads as there are CPU cores (or CPU threads). According to the OpenMP
# standard, the OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable specifies how many threads should be used and GraphicsMagick 
# also honors this request. In order to obtain the best single-user performance, set OMP_NUM_THREADS equal to the 
# number of available CPU cores. On a server with many cores and many programs running at once, there may be benefit 
# to setting OMP_NUM_THREADS to a much smaller value than the number of cores, and sometimes values as low as two 
# (or even one, to disable threading) will offer the best overall system performance. Tuning a large system with OpenMP
# programs running in parallel (competing for resources) is a complex topic and some research and experimentation may
# be required in order to find the best parameters.

# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The 'handy ruler' below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

$PRGNAM: $PRGNAM (The swiss army knife of image processing)
$PRGNAM:
$PRGNAM: GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing. Comprised
$PRGNAM: of 265K physical lines (according to David A. Wheeler's
$PRGNAM: SLOCCount) of source code in the base package (or 1,220K including
$PRGNAM: 3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and efficient collection of
$PRGNAM: tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and manipulating
$PRGNAM: an image in over 88 major formats including important formats like
$PRGNAM: DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, and TIFF.
